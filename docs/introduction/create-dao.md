# Create a DAO on Tomorrow DAO

A DAO, or a decentralized autonomous organisation, is a great way to facilitate governance of a project or community. With TomorrowDAO, you can create a DAO, select different criteria, and create proposals without having any coding experience. The entire no-code process will only take you a few minutes!

## Step 1: Click on Log in

Access the platform via [www.tmrwdao.com](https://www.tmrwdao.com/). First, you have to log in to the application with your wallet, to access the website.

## Step 2: Login with your social credentials or Portkey wallet

Logging in via your social credentials also allows you to create a Portkey wallet to access the application. Alternatively, if you already have a Portkey wallet, you can grant access to the appplication to begin your DAO creation process.

## Step 5: Fill in the necessary details for your DAO

Here, you can fill in the details for your DAO, including its name, logo, and description. For socials, you can select one of the many options, such as Twitter, Discord, Telegram, Facebook or Reddit, or multiple options to quickly gain attention across multiple platforms.

- If you'd like to create a DAO for any token holders (one token one vote), you can also input the ticker for your governance token if it has already been created.
- If you'd like to create a Multisig DAO(one address one vote), you can manage the multisig addresses here once you choose it.


## Step 6: Setting up voting thresholds

On this page, you are setting up the voting thresholds for the DAO referendum, which is the primary governance mechanism.

Here’s what each setting means:

- **Minimum Approval Rate**: the percentage of ‘yes’ votes required among the participants for a proposal to be approved. (Recommend setting it to above 51%)

Adjust these settings according to your governance needs and click “Next” to proceed.


## Step 7: Setting Up the High Council (Optional)

This page allows you to configure the High Council, an optional supplementary governance mechanism for your DAO. Enabling the High Council can provide a more flexible governance model where certain decision-making and specific governance tasks-handling can be more efficient.

After completing these settings, click "Next" to proceed.


## Step 8: Upload your documentation

Here you can upload your DAO's vision, which are typically encapsulated within a white paper, including additional information about the purpose of your DAO. A roadmap is also recommended to illustrate the DAO's plans for the future.

## Step 9: Confirm your DAO details

You will now have the opportunity to review the information you have submitted before you confirm the creation of your DAO. Make sure you have entered all your settings correctly as there will be some settings that are unchangeable post deployment. 

Once you have confirmed the settings, click on "Confirm".
