# Tomorrow DAO

## Introduction

First of all, Tomorrow DAO is a DAO platform built on top of Aelf public blockchain that allows users to create and manage their own DAOs. In Tomorrow DAO, any user can create his or her own DAO, chooses to use Fungible Token or NFT as governance tokens, and invites members to participate in governing the DAO. Furthermore, users can also create proposals, vote on proposals, and deposit funds into the DAO treasury for governance purposes. Last but not the least, Tomorrow DAO offers a user-friendly frontend for initiating governance proposals and executing smart contract methods.
