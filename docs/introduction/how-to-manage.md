# How to Enable and Manage a DAO Treasury with Tomorrow DAO

In the dynamic world of blockchain and decentralised finance (DeFi), the role of effective financial governance in Decentralised Autonomous Organisations (DAOs) is pivotal. A DAO’s treasury does more than safeguard assets; it serves as a vital foundation for empowering the community, funding innovative projects, and facilitating governance actions. TMRWDAO, leveraging the powerful and scalable aelf blockchain, offers a refined treasury management solution that combines accessibility, security, and efficiency to revolutionise how DAOs operate.


## What is a DAO Treasury?

A DAO Treasury is essentially a smart contract-based wallet that holds the collective funds of a DAO. It is the financial hub for managing the DAO's capital, where funds are stored, received, and disbursed under the community’s control through transparent governance mechanisms.

## The Role of Treasury in TMRWDAO

TMRWDAO enhances traditional treasury management with innovative features that allow for seamless financial operations:

- **Asset Reception and Management**: Easily receive and manage a variety of assets including fungible tokens (FTs) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs).
- **Dynamic Fund Allocation**: Engage in real-time asset allocation based on community proposals and votes.
- **Enhanced Security Measures**: Robust security protocols to ensure that assets are protected against unauthorised access and threats.
- **Detailed Recording and Querying**: Maintain transparent records of all transactions and balances, accessible to all DAO members, fostering trust and transparency.
