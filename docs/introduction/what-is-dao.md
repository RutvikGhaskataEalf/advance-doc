# What is DAO?

A DAO, or Decentralized Autonomous Organization, is a new type of organization where its operating rules and decision-making processes are entirely managed through smart contracts on a blockchain. The main features of a DAO include:

1. **Decentralization**: DAOs lack traditional centralized management. All decision-making powers are distributed among the participants. Each member can participate in the organizationâ€™s management and decision-making by holding and using governance tokens.

2. **Autonomy**: The operation and decision-making of a DAO rely on pre-written smart contracts, which automatically execute predefined rules and actions, reducing human intervention and errors.

3. **Transparency**: All operation records and decision-making processes are publicly recorded on the blockchain, available for anyone to view and audit. This transparency ensures the fairness and credibility of the organization.

4. **Smart Contracts**: The core of a DAO is smart contracts, which are self-executing code that automatically performs actions when specific conditions are met, such as allocating funds or conducting votes.

5. **Governance Tokens**: DAOs typically issue governance tokens, which allow holders to vote within the organization on major matters such as project direction and resource allocation. The distribution and use of these tokens ensure the rights and responsibilities of each member.
