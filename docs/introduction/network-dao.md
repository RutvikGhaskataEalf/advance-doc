# Network DAO

### What is Network DAO?

Network DAO is in collaboration with and deployed on TMRWDAO, a DAO creation platform within the aelf ecosystem. Its primary objective is to achieve fully decentralised governance of the aelf blockchain. This allows communities to vote for Block Producers (BPs) and enables BPs to participate directly in decision-making processes. By leveraging smart contracts, Network DAO ensures transparency, security, and the trustless execution of tasks.


### Network DAO Key Features

- **Proposals**: Empowers community members from both TMRWDAO and aelf to submit proposals, which are then voted on by BPs, steering the future direction of the blockchain ecosystem.

- **Organisations**: Supports the establishment and management of decentralised organisations, enhancing collaborative efforts within the community.

- **BP Elections**: Facilitates transparent and equitable elections for Block Producers, critical for maintaining the integrity of decentralised governance.

- **Contract Management**: Simplifies the process of deploying and updating smart contracts, making governance more efficient.

- **Resource Token Trade**: Enables the fluid trading of resource tokens, vital for the economic sustainability of the ecosystem.


### How to Use Network DAO?

Network DAO supports the MainChain AELF and the SideChain tDVV, enabling participants to create and vote on proposals, manage organisations, participate in BP elections, deploy or update contracts, and trade resource tokens. It provides a seamless interface for all governance activities on the aelf blockchain.

This tutorial aims to guide you through the essential steps to effectively use the Network DAO.


#### Step 1: Accessing the Network DAO

- **Participating in BP Elections**

   - Click on "Governance" and then "BP Elections".
   - To become a node, click on "Become a candidate node," stake 100,000 ELF, and ensure your server meets the configuration requirements displayed on the page. Follow the developer documentation titled "How to join the mainnet" for instructions on node deployment. If your node accumulates enough votes to rank in the top 21, you can become a BP and earn block rewards. Each term lasts for one week.
   - To vote for a BP, choose your preferred node from the "Node Table" list and check your voting status under "My Vote".
